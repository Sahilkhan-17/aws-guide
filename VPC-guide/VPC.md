# VPC [Virtual Private Cloud]  

- A VPC is a virtual network that you create in the cloud.  
- It's like having your own network within a larger network.  
- Within this VPC, you can create and manage various resources, such as servers, databases, and storage.  
- This virtual network is completely isolated from other user's networks, so your data and applications are secure and protected.
- Just like a physical network, a VPC has its own set of rules and configurations.
- You can define the IP address range for your VPC.
- To connect your VPC to the internet, you can set up gateways or routers.
- This act as an entry and exit points for traffic going in and out of your VPC.
